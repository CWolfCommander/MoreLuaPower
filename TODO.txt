PRIORITY:
    SetEffect with 0 duration does not cause an effect without a duration
    SetEffect with a custom effect when the effect already exists does nothing

TODO:
    Reset Custom Data Types on reload
    make custom statuses work with XML
    Custom Trigger Stuff:
        Add a Harmony patch that runs after DeckCtrl.RemoveArtifactCard(cardToRemove) and pass the cardToRemove to custom code based on custom triggers
            Same for spells
        last PROJECTILE that hit the being
        multiple inputs for cases like OnHit that have different objects, like the projectile that hit
        maybe make the system general enough that people can do those on their own?
    Follow up on custom brands
    implement the rest of ParticleSystem
    Look into sprite swapping
    custom lua effects without having to go through hoops
    make sure that lua hooks do stuff like run a function every frame
    add example file
    add credits to credits
    debug menu on command

LOOK INTO:
    input system
    multiple weapons
    this.duelDisk.currentCardtridges.Remove(this.cardtridgeFill);
    custom save properties
    custom buttons
    changing the number of cast slots
    adding mod name to script variable
    patching script bytecode on the fly. Because why not.
