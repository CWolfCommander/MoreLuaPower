PetBuff for MoreLuaPower by stephanreiken

If you want your spell to buff pets, add this Action to your spell.
<Action>PetBuffSpell</Action>

Add these Paramaters to the spell in order to control what PetBuffSpell does.

PetBuffInBattleOnly="false" //Only include this if you set it to false, False, or FALSE as true is the default behavior. Generally don't change this as it would allow you to add buffs, shields, or healing to your pets outside of combat.

PetBuffTarget= 	// Choose which pets you want to affect. 
"OnlyMyPets"    // If Player 1 casts the spell, it won't affect the pets Player 2 has. Enemies can also cast it and it will only affect their pets.
"AllPlayerPets"	// This will buff pets of both players.
"TargetsPets" 	// TargetsPets will affect the pets of all beings set as target, use this if you want to buff the pets of something On Hit.
"AllEnemyPets" 	// Enemies generally do not have pets and should not be used without mods that give enemies pets.
"NamedPetID"	// All Pets with a matching BeingID will be affected.

PetID1="PetDragon"	//You can add as many PetIDs as you want to check.
PetID2="PetKitty"	//Keep in mind if you have 2 Pet Kitty on the field, both will be affected
PetID3="PetFox"		//This will also target Enemy Pets which have the ID, not just Player Pets.
...
PetID100="PetCustom"

PetBuffStatus1=
"Heal"   	// Several effects including Heal are also on the list. Heals the target.
"DamageNorm" 	// Deals Damage not ignoring defense.
"Damage" 	// Deals Damage ignoring defense.
"DamageTrue" 	// Deals Damage ignoring defense and shields.
"Invincibility" // Add invincibility.
"CastSpell" 	// Forces the pet to cast a spell. The SpellID is PetBuffExtra1/2/3 etc.
"Defense" 	// Any string that exists in the Status Enum will work. However, an invalid entry will break your spell.
etc... 
PetBuffStatus2="SpellPower"
PetBuffStatus3="Flow"     	// You can set as many different status as you want. Identical entries will work but would be redundent.
...		     	// It will not check PetBuffStatus5 if PetBuffStatus4 doesn't exist etc.
PetBuffStatus100="Trinity"

PetBuffAmount1="1"
PetBuffAmount2="7"    	// If you do not set an amount it usually doesn't do anything.
PetBuffAmount3="11"	
....
PetBuffAmount100="6"


PetBuffDuration1="1"	// You do not need a duration for Heal. Durations are floats.
PetBuffDuration2="0.1"  // Some buffs require a duration in order to have an effect but can be left out for those that do not. For example, Fragile does not need a duration and will ignore a duration but SpellPower requires a duration.
PetBuffDuration3="10"	// If you leave out the duration for a status that requires it, the duration will be 9999 seconds.
...
PetBuffDuration100="2.3"

PetBuffExtra1="None"	  // Extra is a field for only two things right now and is normally "None" and can be skipped
PetBuffExtra2="StepSlash" // CastSpell requires Extra have a SpellID in it
PetBuffExtra3="Cleanse"   // Cleanse when paired with a status effect will remove the status instead.
...
PetBuffExtra1="None"


If you want to run this same system on an Artifact trigger, you'll need to write your own lua faction and run it by the artifact, and have that function run one of these function. 	//You can also run PetBuffSpell with an artifact but you'll need to set the correct Params in the artifact and you won't be able to change the effect between different Apps.

PetBuffArtifactFunction(item, target, status, amount, duration, extra)		// Item needs to be a reference to the item that triggered this effect. 
PetBuffArtifactPetIDFunction(item, petid, status, amount, duration, extra) 	// Targeting by PetID runs this function instead
